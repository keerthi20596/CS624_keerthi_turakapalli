# Input
There is no user input in this app. All information is hardcoded inside the `App.tsx` file using React Native components.

# Process
The app uses a single `View` to wrap three `Text` components. The text strings are styled with a yellow background and aligned in the center of the screen using Flexbox. A StyleSheet is used to apply consistent formatting.

# Output
The app displays three lines of centered text with a full yellow background. The text (name, degree, and school) is shown in black font for contrast and readability.
