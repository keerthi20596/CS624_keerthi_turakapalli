Input
The program begins with a predefined dataset containing six user profiles. Each profile includes a name, occupation, description, and an image. All profiles are initially set to show only a thumbnail image in a grid layout. No user input is required at launch, but interaction is possible via touch.

Process
The app renders all six profiles in a fixed 2x3 matrix layout using Flexbox. Each profile card is styled to maintain a uniform size, ensuring the UI remains consistent. When a user taps on a card, the program toggles that card's showThumbnail value while resetting others. This triggers a re-render where only the selected card reveals its full content (name, occupation, and description) using an overlay, while others remain minimized. State management is handled using React's component state and mapped updates.

Output
The final output is a clean, interactive profile gallery. All cards are visible without scrolling, and tapping a card reveals expanded details without disrupting the layout.
